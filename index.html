            The shutdown began on April 27, 2023, with the Manipur State Government suspending mobile data services in
            the
            districts
            of Churachandpur and Pherzawl amid protests and incidents of violence. On May 3, 2023, as the violence both
            spread and
            intensified, the State Government issued a shutdown order suspending mobile data services for the entire
            territorial
            jurisdiction of Manipur for five days. The following day, it issued an order barring all internet services
            in
            the state,
            including broadband connectivity and VSAT, for five days. Until July 25, 2023, successive orders have been
            issued to extend the shutdown, in what is the fourth longest internet shutdown in Indian history.

        <p class="normal-text">
          On July 25, 2023, considering “the suffering of the Common” and complying with the directions of the Manipur
          High Court, the Government of Manipur issued an order lifting its suspension of broadband services in a
          “liberalised” manner, provided that users meet a list of conditions. The order—made available only via news
          outlets and not uploaded on any government website—stated that mobile internet services would continue to be
          suspended amidst apprehensions of the spread of disinformation and false rumours. The order merely mandated
          the further suspension of mobile data services and internet/data services, without providing any particular
          endpoint for this suspension.
        </p>

        <p class="normal-text">
          After July 25, no new internet suspension orders seem to be available in the public domain. But there
          continues to be no access to mobile internet services in Manipur. It is critical to note that if no new orders
          have been issued after July 25 and if mobile internet continues to be suspended on the basis of the order
          issued on July 25—the ongoing internet clampdown in Manipur is illegal and unlawful; violating the Temporary
          Suspension of Telecom Services (Public Emergency or Public Safety) Rules, 2017 and the Supreme Court&apos;s
          ruling in Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India, which declared indefinite internet shutdowns illegal and imposed
          an obligation on authorities to publish suspension orders.
        </p>

        <p class="normal-text">
          Despite its claims of lifting the suspension of broadband internet in a “liberalised” manner, the order sets
          out conditions that users must fulfil before they can access the internet—ranging from expensive (paying to
          set up static IP connection) to restrictive (social media platforms and VPNs remain banned) to highly invasive
          (agreeing to physical monitoring by state officials and MAC binding of devices). These measures are ultimately
          unlikely to <a href="https://twitter.com/CloudflareRadar/status/1686119806368358400?s=20">ameliorate</a>
          internet access conditions in the state.
        </p>

        <p class="normal-text">
          In a country like India, where the Internet is overwhelmingly accessed through mobile devices and broadband
          Internet is accessible only to the affluent, the continued suspension of mobile data services may essentially
          result in complete Internet shutdown for the majority of the population. According to data from the <a
            href="https://www.trai.gov.in/sites/default/files/QPIR_31052023_0.pdf">Telecom Regulatory Authority of
            India</a>, 96.13% of internet connections are mobile internet connections, compared to 3.74% of wired
          connections.

      <p class="normal-text text-white">
        In India, governments cannot shutdown the internet indefinitely, nor can they do so in secrecy. In 2020, the
        Supreme Court, in Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India ruled that an indefinite internet shutdown is illegal and
        directed that internet shutdown orders must be made publicly available. IFF filed RTI applications with the <a
          href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1i0PF1-6l1J2YvZXhI-qVWCdoP1WO57My/view">Manipur Home Department</a> and
        <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/15kT-Yrs_Qexpy-DRmYX75sVlaKSZlQ1P/view">Manipur Legal Affairs
          Department</a> on July 27, 2023, requesting information and documents pertaining to the internet shutdowns and
        findings of the Review Committee on the legality of shutdowns imposed. We have received no response from the
        authorities yet, despite the 30-day timeline to respond to RTI applications. Moreover, in June 2023, we filed an
        RTI application with the <a
          href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tRu7Misl_fxhFT9OnATljDW4Su-WVyas/view">Manipur Home Department</a> to
        review the state&apos;s compliance with the directions issued by the Supreme Court in Anuradha Bhasin. Since no
        reply was forthcoming from the concerned authorities, we filed a first appeal, of which we are still awaiting a
        response.
      </p>

      <p class="normal-text text-white">
        Until July 25, while no orders had been issued for an indefinite shutdown, it had nonetheless acquired an
        indefinite character. By extending the shutdown every five days through templatised orders, the State Government
        had effectively imposed an indefinite internet shutdown that had no clear end in sight. The orders also provide
        no indication of when the shutdown could be lifted and use a template formula and copy-paste language with
        minimal application of mind, a flagrant violation of the directions issued under Anuradha Bhasin.
      </p>

      <p class="normal-text text-white">
        We have been unable to find any shutdown orders issued after July 25, 2023, either on the websites of the
        Manipur State Government or through news portals or social media. Alarmingly, the July 25 order, while partially
        lifting the suspension of broadband internet services, continued the shutdown of mobile internet services
        without specifying an end date. If no new orders have been issued after July 25, 2023, and yet mobile internet
        continues to be shut down—the ongoing internet shutdown in Manipur is illegal.

        An internet shutdown has real and profound consequences for the people it impacts. A prolonged, seemingly
        indefinite shutdown leaves a devastating, long-term impact on communities, economies, and societies. Despite the
        repercussions demanding a high degree of care and consideration, the State Government has been issuing what is
        essentially the same order multiple times, with little else but the dates changed. Such ‘copy-paste’ orders
        indicate a non-application of mind, as the law and the guidelines issued by the Supreme Court in Anuradha Bhasin
        v. Union of India require them to explain why the internet suspension is necessary, unavoidable, and the least
        intrusive remedy.
      </p>

      <p class="normal-text text-white">
        The only procedural safeguard afforded by the Telecom Suspension Rules against internet shutdowns is in the form
        of a Review Committee, headed by the State&apos;s Chief Secretary, which must meet and determine the legality of
        the
        internet shutdown orders. Disappointingly, there is no record of Manipur&apos;s Review Committee ever meeting or
        considering even one of the several subsequent internet shutdown orders that have been routinely passed by the
        Home Department of the Manipur Government.

          The Government of Manipur has justified its imposition of an internet shutdown as necessary to maintain law

            <span class="italic font-medium">Jan Rydzak</span> employs quantitative methods to examine the relationship
            between internet shutdowns and collective action events in India. His findings show that shutdowns are more
            strongly associated with an increase in violent collective action as opposed to nonviolent mobilisation, and
            thereby, prolonged shutdowns appear to further entrench unrest instead of quelling it. In a similar vein,
            rather than compelling rioters to prematurely cease operations, shutdowns are found to push collective
            action towards greater violence which requires less coordination and communication.

            <span class="italic font-medium">Nishant Shah</span>, a Professor of Global Media at The Chinese University
            of Hong Kong, makes a case against internet shutdowns as a tool to stop the spread of misinformation and
            disinformation. Although a commonly cited justification, Shah argues that an internet shutdown should not be
            equated with an effective information blackout, as communities are able to adapt and build offline
            information ecosystems. Instead, during a shutdown, individuals lose the very tool that makes it possible

            Shah reframes the internet shutdown as the “(dis)information blackout” an information blackout where only a
            few authorised and authoritative information streams are allowed to circulate. It is a critical apparatus
            that uses literal network disconnection to create “filter bubbles” of curated information that produce
            singular narratives and reinforce “official” channels of information.

            A report by the <span class="italic font-medium"> UN Human Rights Office</span>, calling for an end to
            internet shutdowns, warns that internet shutdowns “very rarely meet the proportionality test”. The Report
            refers to internet shutdowns as “powerful markers of deteriorating human rights situations” and notes that
            their use to stop the spread of hate speech or disinformation is incompatible with human rights standards,
            and because of the fear and uncertainty they instil, shutdowns may actually worsen the spread of hate speech

          It seems as though the government would be hard-pressed to back up its claims for such a prolonged internet
          shutdown. Reportedly, when questioned about the effectiveness of internet shutdowns by the Parliamentary
          Standing Committee on Information Technology in 2020, representatives of the <a

        While internet shutdowns may project an image of control and proactivity, as a report by the <a

          Office</a> has noted, shutdowns cause “incalculable damage” which “exceed any hoped-for benefit”. Media
        coverage emerging from Manipur paints a picture of a state in crisis, where an internet shutdown has worsened
        hardship at every turn.
      </p>

      <p class="normal-text text-white">
        The right to access the internet has been recognised by the United Nations, given its proximity to other
        fundamental rights, such as the right to free expression and the right to freedom of assembly. In 2020, the
        Supreme Court of India recognised the right to freedom of speech and expression under Article 19(1)(a), and the
        right to carry on any trade or business under 19(1)(g), using the medium of internet as constitutionally
        protected. In shutting down the internet, the state government has deprived the people of Manipur of these
        rights for 100 days and counting.

      <p class="normal-text text-white">
        Internet shutdowns disrupt economies on a massive scale — from interrupting financial transactions to creating a
        climate of uncertainty that discourages investment. The economic shocks arising from internet shutdowns are felt
        over a long period of time and can worsen existing social inequalities.

          which calculates its estimates of the economic impact of internet shutdowns using the COST Tool developed by
          internet
          monitoring NGO Netblocks. Key indicators included in their calculations include data from the World Bank, ITU,
          Eurostat
          and US Census. Beyond instances of internet blackouts, they also include instances of social media shutdowns
          and severe

          This data was recognised by the Parliamentary Standing on Communications and IT, which also noted further that
          “as per

          every
          Circle Area where there is a shutdown

        <p class="normal-text whitespace-normal">
          Internet shutdowns are an extreme form of online censorship that curtail the right to freedom of expression, a
          right which is particularly critical in situations of political unrest. It prevents the dissemination of
          critical and potentially life-saving information. Shutdowns have also been used as a tool to evade
          accountability. Without the internet, individuals and civil society organisations are often unable to document
          and share evidence of human rights violations. This is particularly concerning as a day after the state-wide
          shutdown of mobile data services, the Manipur state government issued a “shoot-at-sight” order that was
          <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/asa20/6969/2023/en/"> condemned</a> by Amnesty International as
          a “flagrant violation of human rights law and standards”. Internet
          shutdowns make it difficult for journalists to do their jobs. <a
            href="https://nagalandpost.com/index.php/internet-shutdown-hits-media-in-manipur/">Reportedly</a>, according
          to a memorandum submitted
          by the Editors Guild Manipur and the All Manipur Working Journalists’ Union to the state IPR minister, the

          surveillance, and datafied administration; on the other hand, it keeps poised over the proverbial internet
          killswitch, ready to pull the trigger.

          The imposition of an internet shutdown in Manipur was met by widespread criticism from civil society, lawyers,
          human rights activists, parliamentarians, and journalists. These opinion pieces represent only a part of the
          public outcry against the ongoing injustice imposed on the people of Manipur.

        Wholesale suspension of internet services being imposed by democratic governments should never be the answer for
        quelling issues of public order or prevention of misinformation. The harms associated with lack of access to
        internet services outweigh the harms associated with access to the internet. In view of this, the following
        recommendations may be considered by the State to overhaul as well as democratise the process -

            it
            currently stands, the decisions of the Review Committee raise a perception of bias on account of conflict of
            interest as it is required to review the orders which are issued by its own arm of the government.

            In rare situations, rather than imposing a blanket shutdown, selective restriction of specific services or
            websites may be considered. A Consultation Paper released by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India
            (TRAI)
            recommends selective banning of OTT messaging platforms such as WhatsApp, Facebook and Telegram. However,
            reasons should be provided to correlate the banning of the service in question with the objective that is
            sought
            to be achieved.

            In line with the recommendation of the Standing Committee on Communications and Information Technology on
            “Suspension of Telecom Services and Internet and its Impact”, the Department of Telecommunications or the
            Ministry of Home Affairs must maintain a centralised database of all internet shutdowns that are imposed by
            States. Maintenance of such a database will allow policymakers, researchers and other civil society
            activists
            to
            access accurate data pertaining to the suspension of internet services.
