                districts
                of Churachandpur and Pherzawl amid protests and incidents of violence. On May 3, 2023, as the violence both
                spread and
                intensified, the state government issued a shutdown order suspending mobile data services for the entire
                territorial
                jurisdiction of Manipur for five days. The following day, it issued an order barring all internet services in
                the state,
                including broadband connectivity and VSAT, for five days. Since then, successive orders have been issued to
                extend the
                shutdown every five days, in what is the fourth longest internet shutdown in Indian history.

          <p class="normal-text">
              On July 25, 2023, considering “the suffering of the Common” and complying with the directions of the Manipur High Court, the Government of Manipur issued an order lifting its suspension of broadband services in a “liberalised” manner, provided that users meet a list of conditions. The order—made available only via news outlets and not uploaded on any government website—stated that mobile internet services would continue to be suspended amidst apprehensions of the spread of disinformation and false rumours. The order merely mandated the further suspension of mobile data services and internet/data services, without providing any particular endpoint for this suspension. 
          </p>

          <p class="normal-text">
    After July 25, no new internet suspension orders seem to be available in the public domain. But there continues to be no access to mobile internet services in Manipur. It is critical to note that if no new orders have been issued after July 25 and if mobile internet continues to be suspended on the basis of the order issued on July 25—the ongoing internet clampdown in Manipur is illegal and unlawful; violating the Temporary Suspension of Telecom Services (Public Emergency or Public Safety) Rules, 2017 and the Supreme Court’s ruling in Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India, which declared indefinite internet shutdowns illegal and imposed an obligation on authorities to publish suspension orders. 
          </p>

          <p class="normal-text">
    Despite its claims of lifting the suspension of broadband internet in a “liberalised” manner, the order sets out conditions that users must fulfil before they can access the internet—ranging from expensive (paying to set up static IP connection) to restrictive (social media platforms and VPNs remain banned) to highly invasive (agreeing to physical monitoring by state officials and MAC binding of devices). These measures are ultimately unlikely to <a href="https://twitter.com/CloudflareRadar/status/1686119806368358400?s=20">ameliorate</a> internet access conditions in the state. 
          </p>

          <p class="normal-text">
          In a country like India, where the Internet is overwhelmingly accessed through mobile devices and broadband Internet is accessible only to the affluent, the continued suspension of mobile data services may essentially result in complete Internet shutdown for the majority of the population. According to data from the <a href="https://www.trai.gov.in/sites/default/files/QPIR_31052023_0.pdf">Telecom Regulatory Authority of India</a>, 96.13% of internet connections are mobile internet connections, compared to 3.74% of wired connections.

          <p class="normal-text text-white">
          In India, governments cannot shutdown the internet indefinitely, nor can they do so in secrecy. In 2020, the Supreme Court, in Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India ruled that an indefinite internet shutdown is illegal and directed that internet shutdown orders must be made publicly available. IFF filed RTI applications with the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1i0PF1-6l1J2YvZXhI-qVWCdoP1WO57My/view">Manipur Home Department</a> and <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/15kT-Yrs_Qexpy-DRmYX75sVlaKSZlQ1P/view">Manipur Legal Affairs Department</a> on July 27, 2023, requesting information and documents pertaining to the internet shutdowns and findings of the Review Committee on the legality of shutdowns imposed. We have received no response from the authorities yet, despite the 30-day timeline to respond to RTI applications. Moreover, in June 2023, we filed an RTI application with the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tRu7Misl_fxhFT9OnATljDW4Su-WVyas/view">Manipur Home Department</a> to review the state’s compliance with the directions issued by the Supreme Court in Anuradha Bhasin. Since no reply was forthcoming from the concerned authorities, we filed a first appeal, of which we are still awaiting a response. 
          </p>

          <p class="normal-text text-white">
            Until July 25, while no orders had been issued for an indefinite shutdown, it had nonetheless acquired an indefinite character. By extending the shutdown every five days through templatised orders, the State Government had effectively imposed an indefinite internet shutdown that had no clear end in sight. The orders also provide no indication of when the shutdown could be lifted and use a template formula and copy-paste language with minimal application of mind, a flagrant violation of the directions issued under Anuradha Bhasin. 
          </p>

          <p class="normal-text text-white">
We have been unable to find any shutdown orders issued after July 25, 2023, either on the websites of the Manipur State Government or through news portals or social media. Alarmingly, the July 25 order, while partially lifting the suspension of broadband internet services, continued the shutdown of mobile internet services without specifying an end date. If no new orders have been issued after July 25, 2023, and yet mobile internet continues to be shut down—the ongoing internet shutdown in Manipur is illegal. 

          </p>

          <p class="normal-text text-white">
          An internet shutdown has real and profound consequences for the people it impacts. A prolonged, seemingly indefinite shutdown leaves a devastating, long-term impact on communities, economies, and societies. Despite the repercussions demanding a high degree of care and consideration, the State Government has been issuing what is essentially the same order multiple times, with little else but the dates changed. Such ‘copy-paste’ orders indicate a non-application of mind, as the law and the guidelines issued by the Supreme Court in Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India require them to explain why the internet suspension is necessary, unavoidable, and the least intrusive remedy. 
          </p>

          <p class="normal-text text-white">
The only procedural safeguard afforded by the Telecom Suspension Rules against internet shutdowns is in the form of a Review Committee, headed by the State’s Chief Secretary, which must meet and determine the legality of the internet shutdown orders. Disappointingly, there is no record of Manipur’s Review Committee ever meeting or considering even one of the several subsequent internet shutdown orders that have been routinely passed by the Home Department of the Manipur Government.

                       <span class="italic font-medium">Jan Rydzak</span> employs quantitative methods to examine the relationship between internet shutdowns and collective action events in India. His findings show that shutdowns are more strongly associated with an increase in violent collective action as opposed to nonviolent mobilisation, and thereby, prolonged shutdowns appear to further entrench unrest instead of quelling it. In a similar vein, rather than compelling rioters to prematurely cease operations, shutdowns are found to push collective action towards greater violence which requires less coordination and communication.

                   <span class="italic font-medium">Nishant Shah</span>, a Professor of Global Media at The Chinese University of Hong Kong, makes a case against internet shutdowns as a tool to stop the spread of misinformation and disinformation. Although a commonly cited justification, Shah argues that an internet shutdown should not be equated with an effective information blackout, as communities are able to adapt and build offline information ecosystems. Instead, during a shutdown, individuals lose the very tool that makes it possible for them to verify and evaluate information— <a href="https://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc/article/view/13977">the internet</a>.

                   </p>
                   <p class="normal-text text-white text-justify">
                   Shah reframes the internet shutdown as the “(dis)information blackout” an information blackout where only a few authorised and authoritative information streams are allowed to circulate. It is a critical apparatus that uses literal network disconnection to create “filter bubbles” of curated information that produce singular narratives and reinforce “official” channels of information.

                   A report by the <span class="italic font-medium"> UN Human Rights Office</span>, calling for an end to internet shutdowns, warns that internet shutdowns “very rarely meet the proportionality test”. The Report refers to internet shutdowns as  “powerful markers of deteriorating human rights situations” and notes that their use to stop the spread of hate speech or disinformation is incompatible with human rights standards, and because of the fear and uncertainty they instil, shutdowns may actually worsen the spread of hate speech and disinformation.

               It seems as though the government would be hard-pressed to back up its claims for such a prolonged internet shutdown. Reportedly, when questioned about the effectiveness of internet shutdowns by the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Information Technology in 2020, representatives of the <a href="https://www.forbesindia.com/article/special/were-the-republic-day-internet-shutdowns-in-delhi-haryana-necessary/65997/1">Union Home Ministry and Delhi and Bihar State Governments</a> were unable to provide metrics to gauge effectiveness but continued to maintain that they were essential to maintain law and order. In fact, the <a href="https://loksabhadocs.nic.in/lsscommittee/Communications%20and%20Information%20Technology/17_Communications_and_Information_Technology_26.pdf">Parliamentary Standing Committee</a> instead found that the powers of internet suspension were misused by State Governments, leading to huge economic loss, untold suffering to the public, and serious reputational damage to the country.

          <p class="normal-text text-white">
          While internet shutdowns may project an image of control and proactivity, as a report by the <a href="https://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/G22/341/55/PDF/G2234155.pdf?OpenElement">UN Human Rights Office</a> has noted, shutdowns cause “incalculable damage” which “exceed any hoped-for benefit”. Media coverage emerging from Manipur paints a picture of a state in crisis, where an internet shutdown has worsened hardship at every turn. 
          </p>

          <p class="normal-text text-white">
The right to access the internet has been recognised by the United Nations, given its proximity to other fundamental rights, such as the right to free expression and the right to freedom of assembly. In 2020, the Supreme Court of India recognised the right to freedom of speech and expression under Article 19(1)(a), and the right to carry on any trade or business under 19(1)(g), using the medium of internet as constitutionally protected. In shutting down the internet, the state government has deprived the people of Manipur of these rights for 100 days and counting. 
          </p>

          <p class="normal-text text-white">
          Internet shutdowns disrupt economies on a massive scale — from interrupting financial transactions to creating a climate of uncertainty that discourages investment. The economic shocks arising from internet shutdowns are felt over a long period of time and can worsen existing social inequalities.
