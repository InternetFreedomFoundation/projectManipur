                The shutdown began on April 27, 2023, with the Manipur state government suspending mobile data services in the
                districts
                of Churachandpur and Pherzawl amid protests and incidents of violence. On May 3, 2023, as the violence both
                spread and
                intensified, the state government issued a shutdown order suspending mobile data services for the entire
                territorial
                jurisdiction of Manipur for five days. The following day, it issued an order barring all internet services in
                the state,
                including broadband connectivity and VSAT, for five days. Since then, successive orders have been issued to
                extend the
                shutdown every five days, in what is the fourth longest internet shutdown in Indian history.

          <p class="normal-text">
              On July 25, 2023, considering “the suffering of the Common” and complying with the directions of the Manipur High Court, the Government of Manipur issued an order lifting its suspension of broadband services in a “liberalised” manner, provided that users meet a list of conditions. The order—made available only via news outlets and not uploaded on any government website—stated that mobile internet services would continue to be suspended amidst apprehensions of the spread of disinformation and false rumours. The order merely mandated the further suspension of mobile data services and internet/data services, without providing any particular endpoint for this suspension. 
          </p>

          <p class="normal-text">
    After July 25, no new internet suspension orders seem to be available in the public domain. But there continues to be no access to mobile internet services in Manipur. It is critical to note that if no new orders have been issued after July 25 and if mobile internet continues to be suspended on the basis of the order issued on July 25—the ongoing internet clampdown in Manipur is illegal and unlawful; violating the Temporary Suspension of Telecom Services (Public Emergency or Public Safety) Rules, 2017 and the Supreme Court’s ruling in Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India, which declared indefinite internet shutdowns illegal and imposed an obligation on authorities to publish suspension orders. 
          </p>

          <p class="normal-text">
    Despite its claims of lifting the suspension of broadband internet in a “liberalised” manner, the order sets out conditions that users must fulfil before they can access the internet—ranging from expensive (paying to set up static IP connection) to restrictive (social media platforms and VPNs remain banned) to highly invasive (agreeing to physical monitoring by state officials and MAC binding of devices). These measures are ultimately unlikely to ameliorate internet access conditions in the state.

          </p>

          <p class="normal-text">
          In a country like India, where the Internet is overwhelmingly accessed through mobile devices and broadband Internet is accessible only to the affluent, the continued suspension of mobile data services may essentially result in complete Internet shutdown for the majority of the population. According to data from the <a href="https://www.trai.gov.in/sites/default/files/QPIR_31052023_0.pdf">Telecom Regulatory Authority of India</a>, 96.13% of internet connections are mobile internet connections, compared to 3.74% of wired connections.
